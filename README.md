# Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting breast cancer based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. The model is designed to classify whether a breast cancer tumor is malignant or benign using various features derived from cell nuclei present in breast cancer biopsy samples.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection.
Modeling: Multiple algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) have been tested.
Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC metrics are used for model evaluation.

# Dataset
The model is trained and tested on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. This dataset contains 569 samples, each with 30 numerical features describing the characteristics of cell nuclei.

Classes: 2 (Malignant, Benign)
Samples per class: 212 Malignant, 357 Benign
Features: 30 numerical features
